# Auto-Covariance and Auto-Correlation

The [autocovariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocovariance) of a time series refers to the dependence (specifically the [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance)) of values in the time series at time *t* with values at time *h* = *t* − *l*, where *l* is the lag. The [autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) is the covariance normalized by the standard deviations of the covariates. Specifically, assume our time series is stationary and define the autocovariance and autocorrelation according to [Shumway and Stoffer (2017)](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/tsaEZ.pdf) equations 1.27 and 1.26, respectively. Comparing values at time *t* to previous values is useful not only for computing autocovariance, but also for a variety of other time series analyses as well, as you'll see shortly. 

To combine image data with previous values, in Earth Engine, the first step is to join the previous values to the current values. To do that, use a [join](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/joins_intro) to create what we'll call a *lagged collection*:

Create a lagged ImageCollection

Consider the following function to create a lagged collection:

```javascript
var lag = function(leftCollection, rightCollection, lagDays) {
 var filter = ee.Filter.and(
   ee.Filter.maxDifference({
    difference: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * lagDays,
    leftField: timeField, 
    rightField: timeField
   }), 
   ee.Filter.greaterThan({
    leftField: timeField, 
    rightField: timeField
  }));
 return ee.Join.saveAll({
  matchesKey: 'images',
  measureKey: 'delta_t',
  ordering: timeField, 
  ascending: false, // Sort reverse chronologically
 }).apply({
  primary: leftCollection, 
  secondary: rightCollection, 
  condition: filter
 });
};
```

This function joins a collection to itself, using a filter that gets all the images before but within a specified time difference (in days) of each image. That list of previous images within the lag time is stored in a property of the image called images, sorted reverse chronologically. For example, to create a lagged collection from the detrended Landsat imagery:

```javascript
var lagged17 = lag(detrended, detrended, 17);
```

Why 17 days? Recall that the temporal cadence of Landsat is 16 days. Specifying 17 days in the join gets one previous image, but no more. To compute autocovariance or other interesting statistics, map functions over the lagged collection as in the following sections.

Compute autocovariance and autocorrelation


The autocovariance reducer expects a set of one-dimensional arrays as input. So pixel values corresponding to time *t* need to be stacked with pixel values at time *t* − *l* as multiple bands in the same image. Consider the the following function for that purpose:

```javascript
var merge = function(image) {
 // Function to be passed to iterate.
 var merger = function(current, previous) {
  return ee.Image(previous).addBands(current);
 };
 return ee.ImageCollection.fromImages(
image.get('images')).iterate(merger, image);
};
```

and use that function to merge the bands from the lagged collection:

```javascript
var merged17 = ee.ImageCollection(lagged17.map(merge));
```


Now the bands from time *t* and *h* are all in the same image. Note that the band name of *p**h* was the same as *p**t*. During the merging process, it gets a '_1' appended to it. Use a function to convert the merged bands to arrays with bands *p**t* and *p**h*, then reduce with the covariance reducer:

```javascript
var covariance = function(mergedCollection, band, lagBand) {
 return mergedCollection.select([band, lagBand]).map(function(image) {
  return image.toArray();
 }).reduce(ee.Reducer.covariance(), 8);
};
var lagBand = dependent.cat('_1');
var covariance17 = ee.Image(covariance(merged17, dependent, lagBand));
```


The output of the covariance reducer is an array image, in which each pixel stores a 2x2 [variance-covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix) array. The off diagonal elements are covariance, which you can map directly:

```javascript
Map.addLayer(covariance17.arrayGet([0, 1]), {}, 'covariance (lag=17 days)');
```


The diagonal elements of the variance-covariance array are variances. Use this function to compute correlation from the variance-covariance array: 

```javascript
var correlation = function(vcArrayImage) {
 var covariance = ee.Image(vcArrayImage).arrayGet([0, 1]);
 var sd0 = ee.Image(vcArrayImage).arrayGet([0, 0]).sqrt();
 var sd1 = ee.Image(vcArrayImage).arrayGet([1, 1]).sqrt();
 return covariance.divide(sd0).divide(sd1).rename('correlation');
};
```

and map the correlation:

```javascript
var correlation17 = correlation(covariance17);
Map.addLayer(correlation17, {min: -1, max: 1}, 
'correlation (lag = 17 days)');
```

It's worth noting that you can do this for longer lags as well (try 34 days). Of course, that images list will fill up with all the images that are within *l* of *t*. Those other images are also useful, for example in fitting autoregressive models as described later.
