# Time Series

**Overview:** 

One of the paradigm-changing features of Earth Engine is the ability to access decades of imagery without the previous limitation of needing to download. Because files can be enormous, this used to limit many projects to viewing two or three images from different periods. With Earth Engine, users can access tens or hundreds of thousands of images to understand the status of places across decades. 

The purpose of this lab is to establish a foundation for time series analysis of remotely sensed data, usually in the form of a temporally ordered stack of images. You will be introduced to concepts of smoothing, interpolation, linear modeling and phenology. At the completion of the lab, you will be able to perform analysis of multi-temporal data for determining trend and seasonality on a per-pixel basis.
