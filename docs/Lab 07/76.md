# Auto-Regressive Models

The discussion of autocovariance preceded this section in order to introduce the concept of lag. Now that you have a way to get previous values of a variable, it's worth considering [auto-regressive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model). Suppose that pixel values at time *t* depend in some way on previous pixel values. If you have observed significant, non-zero autocorrelations in a time series, this may not be a crazy assumption. Specifically, you may postulate a linear model such as:

*p**t* = *β*0 + *β*1*p**t-1* + *β*2*p**t-2* + *e**t*                              (3)

To fit this model, you need a lagged collection as created previously except with a longer lag (e.g. *l* = 34 days). The next steps are to merge the bands, then reduce with the linear regression reducer.


Create a lagged collection, where the images list stores the two previous images: 

```javascript
var lagged34 = ee.ImageCollection(lag(filteredLandsat, filteredLandsat, 34));
```


Merge the bands of the lagged collection such that each image has bands at time *t* and bands at times *t*-1,..., *t* − *l*. Note that it's necessary to filter out any images that don't have two previous temporal neighbors:

```javascript
var merged34 = lagged34.map(merge).map(function(image) {
 return image.set('n', ee.List(image.get('images')).length());
}).filter(ee.Filter.gt('n', 1));
```


Fit the regression model using the linearRegression() reducer:

```javascript
var arIndependents = ee.List(['constant', 'NDVI_1', 'NDVI_2']);
var ar2 = merged34
 .select(arIndependents.add(dependent))
 .reduce(ee.Reducer.linearRegression(arIndependents.length(), 1));
// Turn the array image into a multi-band image of coefficients.
var arCoefficients = ar2.select('coefficients')
 .arrayProject([0])
 .arrayFlatten([arIndependents]);
```


Compute the fitted values using an [expression](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/image_math#expressions). Because this model is a function of previous pixel values, which may be masked, if any of the inputs to equation 3 are masked, the output of the equation will also be masked. That's why you should use an expression here, unlike the previous linear models of time. 

```javascript
// Compute fitted values.
var fittedAR = merged34.map(function(image) {
 return image.addBands(
  image.expression('beta0 + beta1 * p1 + beta2 * p2', {
   p1: image.select('NDVI_1'),
   p2: image.select('NDVI_2'),
   beta0: arCoefficients.select('constant'),
   beta1: arCoefficients.select('NDVI_1'),
   beta2: arCoefficients.select('NDVI_2')
  }).rename('fitted'));
});
```


Plot the results. Note the missing values that result from masked data

```javascript
print(ui.Chart.image.series(
fittedAR.select(['fitted', 'NDVI']), roi, ee.Reducer.mean(), 30)
  .setSeriesNames(['NDVI', 'fitted'])
  .setOptions({
   title: 'AR(2) model: original and fitted values',
   lineWidth: 1,
   pointSize: 3,
}));
```

At this stage, note that the missing data has become a real problem. Any data point for which at least one of the previous points is masked or missing is also masked. It may be possible to avoid this problem by substituting the output from equation 3 (the modeled value) for the missing or masked data. Unfortunately, the code to make that happen is not straightforward. If you're feeling brave, check out [this solution](https://code.earthengine.google.com/c5fbadc5136d94e80ba428376b05d148).
