# Multi-Temporal Data in Earth Engine

Time series in Earth Engine are represented as image collections. This can make time series analysis complicated because

- There is a different time series in each pixel
- The size (length) of the time series vary across pixels
- Missing data may occur in any pixel at any time (e.g. due to cloud masking)

As a result of these complicating factors, analyzing time series in Earth Engine is unlike traditional methods. Specifically, use joins to define temporal relationships between collection items. As you will soon discover, it's possible to perform many traditional time series methods by mapping functions over joined collections. 

First, some very basic notation. A scalar pixel at time *t* is given by *p**t* and a pixel vector by **p***t*. An estimate is a variable with a hat on: e.g. the estimated pixel value at time is *pÌ‚**t*. A time series is just a collection of *N* pixels, sorted chronologically: {**p***t*; *t* = *t**0*...*t**N*}, where *t* might be in any units, *t**0* is the smallest and *t**N* is the largest such *t* in the series.

##  Data Preparation and Preprocessing

The first step in analysis of time series data is to import data of interest and plot it at an interesting location.

Load a time series of Landsat data

Search for Landsat 8 surface reflectance and import the "USGS Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Tier 1" collection. Name it l8sr.

Make a single point geometry with the geometry drawing tools and position the point in a location of interest. (How about an annual grassland or a deciduous forest?) Name the import roi.

Filtering, masking and preparing bands of interest

preprocess the Landsat imagery by filtering it to the location of interest, masking clouds, and adding the variables in the model:

```javascript
// This field contains UNIX time in milliseconds.
var timeField = 'system:time_start';
// Function to cloud mask from the pixel_qa band of Landsat 8 SR data.
// (From the Code Editor Examples > Cloud Masking)
function maskL8sr(image) {
 // Bits 3 and 5 are cloud shadow and cloud, respectively.
 var cloudShadowBitMask = 1 << 3;
 var cloudsBitMask = 1 << 5;
 // Get the pixel QA band.
 var qa = image.select('pixel_qa');
 // Both flags should be set to zero, indicating clear conditions.
 var mask = qa.bitwiseAnd(cloudShadowBitMask).eq(0)
   .and(qa.bitwiseAnd(cloudsBitMask).eq(0));
 // Return the masked image, scaled to reflectance, without the QA bands.
 return image.updateMask(mask).divide(10000)
   .select('B[0-9]*')
   .copyProperties(image, ['system:time_start']);
}
```

 

```javascript
// Use this function to add variables for NDVI, time and a constant
// to Landsat 8 imagery.
var addVariables = function(image) {
 // Compute time in fractional years since the epoch.
 var date = ee.Date(image.get(timeField));
 var years = date.difference(ee.Date('1970-01-01'), 'year');
 // Return the image with the added bands.
 return image
  // Add an NDVI band.
  .addBands(image.normalizedDifference(['B5', 'B4']).rename('NDVI'))
  // Add a time band.
  .addBands(ee.Image(years).rename('t'))
  .float()
  // Add a constant band.
  .addBands(ee.Image.constant(1));
};
// Remove clouds, add variables and filter to the area of interest.
var filteredLandsat = l8sr
 .filterBounds(roi)
 .map(maskL8sr)
 .map(addVariables);
```

Plot the time series at the location of interest

To visualize the data, make a chart at the location of interest. Add a linear trend line for reference (you'll compute that line soon):

```javascript
// Plot a time series of NDVI at a single location.

var l8Chart = ui.Chart.image.series(filteredLandsat.select('NDVI'), roi)
  .setChartType('ScatterChart')
  .setOptions({
   title: 'Landsat 8 NDVI time series at ROI',
   trendlines: {0: {
				color: 'CC0000'
   }},
   lineWidth: 1,
   pointSize: 3,
  });
print(l8Chart);
```

You should see something like this:
