# Cross-Covariance and Cross-Correlation

Cross-covariance is analogous to auto-covariance, except instead of measuring the correspondence between a variable and itself at a lag, it measures the correspondence between a variable and a covariate at a lag. Specifically, define the cross-covariance and cross-correlation according to [Shumway and Stoffer (2017)](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/tsaEZ.pdf) equations 1.30 and 1.31, respectively. 

You already have all the code needed to compute cross-covariance and cross-correlation! But you do need a time series of another variable. Suppose we postulate that NDVI is related in some way to the precipitation before the NDVI was observed. To estimate the strength of this relationship (in every pixel), load precipitation, join, merge, and reduce as previously:

```javascript
// Precipitation (covariate)
 var chirps = ee.ImageCollection('UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/PENTAD');
// Join the t-l (l=1 pentad) precipitation images to the Landsat.
var lag1PrecipNDVI = lag(filteredLandsat, chirps, 5);
// Add the precipitation images as bands.
var merged1PrecipNDVI = ee.ImageCollection(lag1PrecipNDVI.map(merge));
// Compute and display cross-covariance.
var cov1PrecipNDVI = covariance(merged1PrecipNDVI, 'NDVI', 'precipitation');
Map.addLayer(cov1PrecipNDVI.arrayGet([0, 1]), {}, 'NDVI - PRECIP cov (lag = 5)');
// Compute and display cross-correlation.
var corr1PrecipNDVI = correlation(cov1PrecipNDVI);
Map.addLayer(corr1PrecipNDVI, {min: -0.5, max: 0.5}, 'NDVI - PRECIP corr (lag = 5)');
```

What do you observe from this result? Specifically, how can we do better? One possible drawback of this computation is that it's only based on five days of precipitation, whichever five days came right before the NDVI image. Perhaps precipitation in the month before the observed NDVI is relevant? Test that idea with the following:

```javascript
// Join the precipitation images from the previous month
var lag30PrecipNDVI = lag(filteredLandsat, chirps, 30);
print(lag30PrecipNDVI);
var sum30PrecipNDVI = ee.ImageCollection(lag30PrecipNDVI.map(function(image) {
 var laggedImages = ee.ImageCollection.fromImages(image.get('images'));
 return ee.Image(image).addBands(laggedImages.sum().rename('sum'));
}));
// Compute covariance.
var cov30PrecipNDVI = covariance(sum30PrecipNDVI, 'NDVI', 'sum');
Map.addLayer(cov1PrecipNDVI.arrayGet([0, 1]), {}, 'NDVI - sum cov (lag = 30)');
// Correlation.
var corr30PrecipNDVI = correlation(cov30PrecipNDVI);
Map.addLayer(corr30PrecipNDVI, {min: -0.5, max: 0.5}, 'NDVI - sum corr (lag = 30)');
```

Observe that the only change is to the merge() method. Instead of merging the bands of the NDVI image and the covariate (precipitation), the entire list of precipitation is summed and added as a band (eliminating the need for iterate()).

As long as there is sufficient temporal overlap between the time series, these techniques can be extended to longer lags and longer time series. But watch out. There are some nuances to determining the statistical significance of correlation estimates. See [Shumway and Stoffer (2017)](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/tsaEZ.pdf) example 1.26 for details.
