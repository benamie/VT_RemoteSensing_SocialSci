# Linear Filtering

In the present context, linear *filtering* (or [convolution](http://www.dspguide.com/ch24/1.htm)) refers to a linear combination of pixel values in a neighborhood. The neighborhood is specified by a [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)), where the weights of the kernel determine the coefficients in the linear combination. (For this lab, the terms *kernel* and *filter* are interchangeable.) Filtering an image can be useful for extracting image information at different [spatial frequencies](http://www.dspguide.com/ch24/5.htm). For this reason, smoothing filters are called *low-pass* filters (they let *low*-frequency data *pass* through) and edge detection filters are called *high-pass* filters. To implement filtering in Earth Engine use [image.convolve()](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/image_convolutions) with an ee.Kernel for the argument.

## Smoothing

Smoothing means to convolve an image with a smoothing kernel. 


A simple smoothing filter is a square kernel with uniform weights that sum to one. Convolving with this kernel sets each pixel to the mean of its neighborhood. Print a square kernel with uniform weights (this is sometimes called a "pillbox" or "boxcar" filter):

```javascript
// Print a uniform kernel to see its weights.
print('A uniform kernel:', ee.Kernel.square(2));
```

Expand the kernel object in the console to see the weights. This kernel is defined by how many pixels it covers (i.e. radius is in units of 'pixels'). A kernel with radius defined in 'meters' adjusts its size in pixels, so you can't visualize its weights, but it's more flexible in terms of adapting to inputs of different scale. In the following, use kernels with radius defined in meters except to visualize the weights.


Define a kernel in with 2-meter radius (Which corresponds to how many pixels in the NAIP image? Hint: try [projection.nominalScale()](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/projections), convolve the image with the kernel and compare the input image with the smoothed image:

```javascript
// Define a square, uniform kernel.
var uniformKernel = ee.Kernel.square({
 radius: 2,
 units: 'meters',
});
// Filter the image by convolving with the smoothing filter.
var smoothed = image.convolve(uniformKernel);
Map.addLayer(smoothed, {min: 0, max: 255}, 'smoothed image');
```


To make the image even more smooth, try increasing the size of the neighborhood by increasing the pixel radius.


A Gaussian kernel can also be used for smoothing. Think of filtering with a Gaussian kernel as computing the weighted average in each pixel's neighborhood. For example:

```javascript
// Print a Gaussian kernel to see its weights.
print('A Gaussian kernel:', ee.Kernel.gaussian(2));
// Define a square Gaussian kernel:
var gaussianKernel = ee.Kernel.gaussian({
 radius: 2,
 units: 'meters',
});
// Filter the image by convolving with the Gaussian filter.
var gaussian = image.convolve(gaussianKernel);
Map.addLayer(gaussian, {min: 0, max: 255}, 'Gaussian smoothed image');
```

## Edge Detection

Convolving with an edge-detection kernel is used to find rapid changes in DNs that usually signify edges of objects represented in the image data. 


A classic edge detection kernel is the [Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Laplace_operator) kernel. Investigate the kernel weights and the image that results from convolving with the Laplacian:

```javascript
// Define a Laplacian filter.
var laplacianKernel = ee.Kernel.laplacian8();
// Print the kernel to see its weights.
print(laplacianKernel);
// Filter the image by convolving with the Laplacian filter.
var edges = image.convolve(laplacianKernel)
       .reproject('EPSG:26910', null, 1);
Map.addLayer(edges, {min: 0, max: 255}, 'Laplacian filtered image');
```


Other edge detection kernels include the [Sobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator), [Prewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator) and [Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_cross) kernels. [Learn more about additional edge detection methods in Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/image_edges).

## Gradients

Image gradient is the change in pixel values over space (analogous to computing slope from a DEM). 


In Earth Engine, use [image.gradient()](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/image_gradients) to compute the gradient in an image band. For example, gradients in the NIR band indicate transitions in vegetation:

```javascript
// Compute the image gradient in the X and Y directions.
var xyGrad = image.select('N').gradient();
// Compute the magnitude of the gradient.
var gradient = xyGrad.select('x').pow(2)
    .add(xyGrad.select('y').pow(2)).sqrt()
  		.reproject('EPSG:26910', null, 1);
// Compute the direction of the gradient.
var direction = xyGrad.select('y')
				.atan2(xyGrad.select('x'))
				.reproject('EPSG:26910', null, 1);
// Display the results.
Map.setCenter(-122.054, 37.7295, 10);
Map.addLayer(direction, {min: -3, max: 3, format: 'png'}, 'direction');
Map.addLayer(gradient, {min: -10, max: 50, format: 'png'}, 'gradient');
```


 (Ignore the reproject() call for now. It is explained in section 6.)

## Sharpening

Image sharpening, or [edge enhancement](http://www.dspguide.com/ch24/2.htm), is related to the idea of the image second derivative. Specifically, mimic the perception of [Mach bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_bands) in human optical response by adding the image to its second derivative. 


One implementation of this idea is to convolve an image with a Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian or [Difference-of-Gaussians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians) filter (see [Schowengerdt 2007](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123694072) for details), then add that to the input image: 

```javascript
// Define a "fat" Gaussian kernel.
var fat = ee.Kernel.gaussian({
				radius: 3,
 			sigma: 3,
 			magnitude: -1,
 			units: 'meters'
});
// Define a "skinny" Gaussian kernel.
var skinny = ee.Kernel.gaussian({
 			radius: 3,
 			sigma: 0.5,
 			units: 'meters'
});
// Compute a difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) kernel.
var dog = fat.add(skinny);
// Add the DoG filtered image to the original image.
var sharpened = image.add(image.convolve(dog));
Map.addLayer(sharpened, {min: 0, max: 255}, 'Edges enhanced');
```
