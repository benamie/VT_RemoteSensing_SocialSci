# Texture

Define texture as some measure of DN distribution within a neighborhood. There are a variety of ways to [compute texture in Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/image_texture).

## Standard Deviation (SD)

The SD measures the spread of the DN distribution in the neighborhood. A textureless neighborhood, in which there is only one DN, has SD=0. Compute neighborhood SD for the NAIP image with:

```javascript
// Define a big neighborhood with a 7-meter radius kernel.
var bigKernel = ee.Kernel.square({
 radius: 7,
 units: 'meters'
});
// Compute SD in a neighborhood.
var sd = image.reduceNeighborhood({
 reducer: ee.Reducer.stdDev(), 
 kernel: bigKernel
});
Map.addLayer(sd, {min: 0, max: 70}, 'SD');
```

## Entropy

For discrete valued inputs, you can compute [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Shannon_index) in a neighborhood, where entropy     in this context is like an index of DN diversity in the neighborhood:

```javascript
// Compute entropy in a neighborhood.
var entropy = image.entropy(bigKernel);
Map.addLayer(entropy, {min: 1, max: 5}, 'entropy');
```

## Gray-level Co-Occurrence Matrices (GLCM)

The GLCM is computed by forming an *M*x*M* matrix for an image with *M possible DN values, then computing entry *i*,*j* as the frequency at which DN=*i* is adjacent to DN=*j*. A variety of texture metrics can be computed from that matrix, among them is contrast:

```javascript
// Use the GLCM to compute a large number of texture measures.
var glcmTexture = image.glcmTexture(7);
// Display the 'contrast' results for the red, green and blue bands.
var contrastVis = {
 bands: ['R_contrast', 'G_contrast', 'B_contrast'], 
 min: 40,
 max: 2000
};
Map.addLayer(glcmTexture, contrastVis, 'contrast');
```

## Spatial statistics

Two interesting texture measures from the field of spatial statistics include local [Moran's I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran's_I) and local [Geary's C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geary's_C) ([Anselin 1995](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x/abstract)). To compute a local Geary's C with the NAIP image as input, use:

```javascript
// Create a list of weights for a 9x9 kernel.
var list = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1];
// The center of the kernel is zero.
var centerList = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1];
// Assemble a list of lists: the 9x9 kernel weights as a 2-D matrix.
var lists = [list, list, list, list, centerList, list, list, list, list];
// Create the kernel from the weights.
// Non-zero weights represent the spatial neighborhood.
var kernel = ee.Kernel.fixed(9, 9, lists, -4, -4, false);
// Use the max among bands as the input.
var maxBands = image.reduce(ee.Reducer.max());
// Convert the neighborhood into multiple bands.
var neighs = maxBands.neighborhoodToBands(kernel);
// Compute local Geary's C, a measure of spatial association.
var gearys = maxBands.subtract(neighs)
				.pow(2)
				.reduce(ee.Reducer.sum())
				.divide(Math.pow(9, 2));
Map.addLayer(gearys, {min: 20, max: 2500}, "Geary's C");
```
