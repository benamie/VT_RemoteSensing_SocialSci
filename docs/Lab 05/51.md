# Classification & Regression

## Overview

Image classification is a fundamental goal of remote sensing. It takes the user from viewing an image to labeling its contents. This chapter walks users through the many options for image classification in Earth Engine.  

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to concepts of supervised classification. You will explore processes of training data collection, classifier selection, classifier training, image classification and accuracy assessment.

## Introduction to Classification

For present purposes, define prediction as guessing the value of some geographic variable of interest *g*, using a function *G* that takes as input a pixel vector **p**: 

*G***T**(**p***i*) = *g**i* 

The *i* in this equation refers to a particular instance from a set of pixels. Think of *G* as a guessing function and *g**i* as the guess for pixel *i*.  The **T** in the subscript of *G* refers to a *training set* (a set of known values for **p** and the correct *g*), used to infer the structure of *G*. You have to choose a suitable *G* to train with **T**. When *g* is nominal (e.g. {'water', 'vegetation', 'bare'}), call this setup classification. When *g* is numeric, call this setup regression. This is an incredibly simplistic description of a problem addressed in a broad range of fields including mathematics, statistics, data mining, machine learning, etc. Interested readers may see [Witten et al.
