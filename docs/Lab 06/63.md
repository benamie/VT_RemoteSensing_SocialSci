# Nonlinear Regression

If the garden variety linear regression isn't satisfactory, Earth Engine contains other functions that can make predictions of a continuous variable. Unlike linear regression, other regression functions are implemented by the classifier library. 


For example, a Classification and Regression Tree (CART, see [Brieman et al. 1984](https://books.google.com/books/about/Classification_and_Regression_Trees.html?id=JwQx-WOmSyQC)) is a machine learning algorithm that can learn non-linear patterns in your data. Reusing the **T** table (without the constant term), train a CART as follows:

```javascript
var cartRegression = ee.Classifier.smileCart()
  .setOutputMode('REGRESSION')
  .train({
   features: training, 
   classProperty: 'Percent_Tree_Cover', 
   inputProperties: predictionBands
  });
```


Make predictions over the input imagery (classify in this context is a misnomer):

```javascript
var cartRegressionImage = landsat.select(predictionBands)
  .classify(cartRegression, 'cartRegression');
Map.addLayer(cartRegressionImage, {min: 0, max: 100}, 'CART regression');
```


Compare the linear regression to the CART regression. What do you observe? Although CART can work in both classification and regression mode, not all the classifiers are so easily adaptable.
