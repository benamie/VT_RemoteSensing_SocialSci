# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Like the TC transform, the [PCA transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) is a rotational transform in which the new basis is orthonormal, but the axes are determined from statistics of the input image, rather than empirical data. Specifically, the new basis is the [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) of the image's [variance-covariance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix). As a result, the PCs are uncorrelated. To demonstrate, use the Landsat 8 image, converted to an array image:

```javascript
var bands = ['B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B5', 'B6', 'B7', 'B10', 'B11'];
var arrayImage =  image.select(bands).toArray();  
```

In the next step, use the [reduceRegion() method](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reducers_reduce_region) to compute statistics (band covariances) for the image. (Here the region is just the image footprint):

```javascript
var covar = arrayImage.reduceRegion({
  reducer: ee.Reducer.covariance(),
  maxPixels: 1e9
});
var covarArray = ee.Array(covar.get('array'));  
```

A [*reducer*](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reducers_intro) is an object that tells Earth Engine what statistic to compute. Note that the result of the reduction is an object with one property, array, that stores the covariance matrix. The next step is to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of that covariance matrix:

```javascript
var eigens = covarArray.eigen();  
```

Since the eigenvalues are appended to the eigenvectors, slice the two apart and discard the eigenvectors 

```javascript
var eigenVectors = eigens.slice(1, 1);  
```

Perform the matrix multiplication, as with the TC components:

```javascript
var principalComponents =  ee.Image(eigenVectors)   .matrixMultiply(arrayImage.toArray(1));  
```

Finally, convert back to a multi-band image and display the first PC:

```javascript
var pcImage = principalComponents    
// Throw out an an  unneeded dimension, [[]] -> [].    
				.arrayProject([0])    
// Make the one band  array image a multi-band image, [] -> image.    
				.arrayFlatten(
          [['pc1', 'pc2', 'pc3', 'pc4', 'pc5', 'pc6', 'pc7', 'pc8']]
        );      
Map.addLayer(pcImage.select('pc1'), {}, 'PC');  
```

 

Use the [layer manager](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground#layer-manager) to stretch the result. What do you observe? Try displaying some of the other principal components.
