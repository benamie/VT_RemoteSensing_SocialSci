# Spectral Indices

Spectral indices are based on the fact that reflectance spectra of different land covers are different. The indices are designed to exploit these differences to accentuate particular land cover types. Consider the following chart of reflectance spectra for various targets.

Observe that the land covers are separable at one or more wavelengths. Note, in particular, that vegetation curves (green) have relatively high reflectance in the NIR range, where radiant energy is scattered by cell walls ([Bowker et al. 1985](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19850022138.pdf)). Also note that vegetation has low reflectance in the red range, where radiant energy is [absorbed by chlorophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll#/media/File:Chlorophyll_ab_spectra-en.svg). These observations motivate the formulation of vegetation indices, some of which are described in the following sections.
