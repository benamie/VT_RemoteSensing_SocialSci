#Spectral Unmixing

The [linear spectral mixing model](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=974727&tag=1) is based on the assumption that each pixel is a mixture of "pure" spectra. The pure spectra, called *endmembers*, are from land cover classes such as water, bare land, vegetation. The goal is to solve the following equation for **f**, the *P*x1 vector of endmember fractions in the pixel:  

**Sf** = **p**

where **S** is a *B*x*P* matrix in which the columns are *P* pure endmember spectra (known) and **p** is the *B*x1 pixel vector when there are *B* bands (known). In this example, *B*=6: 

```javascript
var unmixImage = image.select(['B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B5', 'B6', 'B7']);  
```

The first step is to get the endmember spectra. Do that by computing the mean spectra in polygons delineated around regions of pure land cover. Zoom the map to a location with homogeneous areas of bare land, vegetation and water (hint: SFO). Visualize the input as a false color composite.

```javascript
Map.addLayer(image, {bands: ['B5', 'B4', 'B3'], max: 0.4}, 'false color');  
```

Using the [geometry drawing tools](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground#geometry-tools), make three new layers (*P*=3) by clicking **+ new layer**. In the first layer, digitize a polygon around pure bare land; in the second layer make a polygon of pure vegetation; in the third layer, make a water polygon. Name the imports bare, veg, and water, respectively. Check the polygons you made by charting mean spectra in them using [Chart.image.regions()](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/charts_image_regions):

```javascript
print(Chart.image.regions(unmixImage,
                          ee.FeatureCollection([
  ee.Feature(bare, {label: 'bare'}),
  ee.Feature(water, {label: 'water'}),
  ee.Feature(veg, {label: 'vegetation'})]),
                          ee.Reducer.mean(), 
                          ,  
                          'label', 
                          [0.48, 0.56, 0.65, 0.86, 1.61, 2.2]));  
```

Your chart should look something like:

Use the [reduceRegion() method](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reducers_reduce_region) to compute mean spectra in the polygons you made. Note that the return value of reduceRegion() is a Dictionary, with reducer output keyed by band name. Get the means as a List by calling values():

```javascript
var bareMean = unmixImage.reduceRegion(
  ee.Reducer.mean(), bare, 30).values();   
var waterMean = unmixImage.reduceRegion(
  ee.Reducer.mean(), water, 30).values();   
var vegMean = unmixImage.reduceRegion(
  ee.Reducer.mean(), veg, 30).values();  
```

Each of these three lists represents a mean spectrum vector. Stack the vectors into a 6x3 Array of endmembers by concatenating them along the 1-axis (or columns direction):

```javascript
var endmembers = ee.Array.cat([bareMean,  vegMean, waterMean], 1);  
```

 Turn the 6-band input image into an image in which each pixel is a 1D vector (toArray()), then into an image in which each pixel is a 6x1 matrix (toArray(1)):

```javascript
var arrayImage = unmixImage.toArray().toArray(1);
```

Now that the dimensions match, in each pixel, solve the equation for **f**:

```javascript
  var unmixed =  ee.Image(endmembers).matrixSolve(arrayImage);
```

Finally, convert the result from a 2D array image into a 1D array image (arrayProject()), then to a multi-band image (arrayFlatten()). The three bands correspond to the estimates of bare, vegetation and water fractions in **f**: 

```javascript
var unmixedImage = unmixed.arrayProject([0])
				.arrayFlatten(
          [['bare', 'veg', 'water']]
        );  
```

Display the result where bare is red, vegetation is green, and water is blue (the addLayer() call expects bands in order, RGB)

```javascript
Map.addLayer(unmixedImage, {}, 'Unmixed');  
```
