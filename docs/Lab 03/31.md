# Spectral Indices & Transformations

## Overview 

The purpose of this lab is to enable you to extract, visualize, combine, and transform spectral data in Google Earth Engine so as to highlight and indicate the relative abundance of particular features of interest from an image. At completion, you should be able to understand the difference between wavelengths, load visualizations displaying relevant indices and compare the relevant applications for varying spectral transformations.

** Diversify to include other types (non ecological/environmental) spectral indices

** Add image of what vegetation and non-vegetation look like with NDVI

** Elaborate on how these indices are used
