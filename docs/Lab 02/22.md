# Searching for Imagery

The Landsat program is a joint NASA/USGS program that has launched a sequence of Earth observation satellites, named Landsat 1, 2,... etc. Note that the Landsat program has resulted in the [longest continuous observation of the Earth's surface](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZx1xmNGcXI?list=PLD240BBC85537B9BE). In this exercise, you will load a Landsat scene over your area of interest, inspect the units and make a plot of radiance.  Specifically, use imagery from the Landsat 8, the most recent of the [sequence of Landsat satellites](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-8). To inspect a Landsat 8 image (also called a *scene*) in your region of interest (ROI), define your ROI as a point, filter the image collection to get a scene with few clouds, and display some information about the image in the console.


Search for 'San Francisco' in the playground search bar and click the result under “Places” to pan and zoom the map to San Francisco. ![Map  Description automatically generated](./clip_image001.png)

Use the [geometry tools](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground#geometry-tools) to make a point in San Francisco (Exit the drawing tool when you're finished). Name the resultant [import](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground#imports) 'point' by clicking on the import name ('geometry' by default).

Search for 'landsat 8 raw' and import the 'USGS Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 Raw Scenes' ImageCollection. Name the import 'landsat'.

Filter the ImageCollection by date and location, sort by a metadata property called 'CLOUD_COVER' and get the first image out of this sorted collection:

```javascript
//  Note that we need to cast the result of first() to Image.   
var image = ee.Image(landsat        
                     //  Filter to get only images in the specified range.  
                     .filterDate('2014-01-01',  '2014-12-31')        
                     //  Filter to get only images at the location of the point.     
                     .filterBounds(point)        
                     //  Sort the collection by a metadata property.     
                     .sort('CLOUD_COVER')        
                     //  Get the first image out of this collection.     
                     .first());  

//  Print the image to the console 
print('A Landsat scene:', image);  
```

The variable image now stores a reference to an object of type ee.Image. Display a human-readable representation of the image by printing it to the console:

Activate the [**Console**](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground#console-tab) and observe that after the descriptive text, an object is displayed. Expand and explore the     object by clicking the little triangle (►) next to the image name to see more information stored in that object. Specifically, expand properties and inspect the long list of metadata items stored as properties of the image. This is where that CLOUD_COVER property you just used is stored.

Note that there are band specific coefficients (RADIANCE_ADD_*, RADIANCE_MULT_* where * is a band name) in the metadata for converting from the digital number (DN) stored by the image into physical units of radiance. These coefficients will be useful in later exercises.
