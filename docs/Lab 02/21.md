# Digital Imagery & Image Processing

## Overview 

The purpose of this lab is to enable you to search, find and visualize remotely sensed imagery in Google Earth Engine. At completion, you should be able to understand the difference between radiance and reflectance, load imagery with the units of interest (radiance or reflectance, for example), make true color and false color composites and visually identify land cover types based on spectral characteristics.

## Learning Outcomes

- Search and import imagery in GEE
- Extract single scenes from collections of images
- Create and visualize different composites according to desired parameters
- Use the Inspector tab to assess pixel values
- Understand the difference between radiance and reflectance through visualization
