# Visualizing Landsat Imagery

Recall that [Landsat 8 measures radiance in multiple spectral bands](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=11491). A common way to visualize images is to set the red band to display in red, the green band to display in green and the blue band to display in blue. This means trying to match the [spectral response of the instrument](http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/?p=5779) to the spectral response of the photoreceptors in the human eye. It's not a perfect match. Despite that, a visualization done in this manner is called a *true-color* image. When the display bands don't match human visual perception, the resultant visualization is called a *false-color composite*. In this exercise, you will make several different visualizations of the scene you found in exercise 1. 


Add the image found in exercise 1 to the map display with the following code: 

```javascript
//  Define visualization parameters in a JavaScript dictionary.   
var trueColor = {    
  bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'],    
  min: 4000,    
  max: 12000};  
// Add the image to the  map, using the visualization parameters.   
Map.addLayer(image, trueColor, 'true-color image');  
```

Observe that this Image is displayed according to the visualization instructions in the trueColor dictionary object. Specifically, bands is a list of three bands to display as red, green and blue, respectively (first band is red, second is green, third is blue). To understand where these band names come from, inspect the bands property of the image in the **Console**. To understand how to match bands to colors, see [this helpful page](http://landsat.usgs.gov/band_designations_landsat_satellites.php) and [this  one](http://landsat.usgs.gov/L8_band_combos.php).

There is more than one way to discover the appropriate min and max values to display. Try going to the [**Inspector** tab](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground#inspector-tab) and clicking somewhere on the map. Note that value in each band, in the pixel where you clicked, is displayed as a list in the **Inspector**. Try clicking on dark and bright objects to get a sense of the range of pixel values. Also note that the [layer manager](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground#layer-manager) in the upper right of the map display lets you automatically compute a linear stretch based on the pixels in the map display. 

Define a new set of visualization parameters and use them to add the image to the map as a false-color composite. This particular set of bands results in a *color-IR composite* because the near infra-red (NIR) band is set to red:

```javascript
//  Define false-color visualization parameters.   
var falseColor = {    bands: ['B5', 'B4', 'B3'],    min: 4000,    max: 13000   };  
// Add the image to the  map, using the visualization parameters.   
Map.addLayer(image, falseColor, 'false-color composite'); 
```


1. Try playing with band combinations, min and max DNs to achieve different visualizations. Note that you can compare the displays by toggling layers on and off with the layer manager.

###  Plot at-Sensor Radiance

The image data you have used so far is stored as DNs. To convert DN values into at-sensor [radiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiance) units in Watts/m2/sr/ùùÅm, use a linear equation of the form

*L*ùùÄ = *a*ùùÄ*DNùùÄ + *b*ùùÄ    (1)

Note that every term is indexed by lamda (ùùÄ, the symbol for wavelength) because the coefficients are different in each band. See [Chander et al. (2009)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425709000169) for details on this linear transformation between DN and radiance. In this exercise, you will generate a radiance image and examine the differences in radiance from different targets.


Perform the transformation in equation 1 using the Earth Engine function for converting Landsat imagery to radiance in Watts/m2/sr/ùùÅm. It will automatically look up the right metadata values for each band and apply the equation for you

```javascript
//  Use these bands.    
var bands = ['B1', 'B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B5', 'B6', 'B7', 'B10', 'B11'];  
// Get an image that  contains only the bands of interest.   
var dnImage = image.select(bands);  
// Apply the  transformation.   
var radiance =  ee.Algorithms.Landsat.calibratedRadiance(dnImage);  
// Display the result.   
var radParams = {bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], min: 0, max: 100};   
Map.addLayer(radiance, radParams, 'radiance');  
```

Note that this code applies the transformation to a subset of bands (specified by a list of band names) obtained from the image using select(). That is to facilitate interpretation of the radiance spectrum by removing the panchromatic band ('B8'), an atmospheric absorption band ('B9') and the QA band ('BQA'). Also note that the visualization parameters are different to account for the radiance units.

Inspect the radiance image by activating the **Inspector** and clicking locations on the map. (It may be easier if you turn off the other images you're displaying by commenting Map.addLayer() lines from previous exercises. Comment a line with the Ctrl-/ shortcut or two forward slashes at the start of the line). Click on different land cover types and in the **Inspector**, and click the chart icon (![img](/Users/ozzycampos/OneDrive/03_Projects/01_RemoteSensing/05_GoogleEarthEngine/Lab 02/clip_image002.png)) to get a chart of the pixel values. If the shape of the chart resembles Figure 1, that's because the radiance (in bands 1-7) is mostly reflected solar irradiance. The radiance detected in bands 10-11 is thermal, and is *emitted (not reflected) from the surface.
