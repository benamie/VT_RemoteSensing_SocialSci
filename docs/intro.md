# Google Earth Engine Introduction

## Why Google Earth Engine? 

Research in Remote Sensing has evolved drastically over the past few decades. 

In the earliest years of satellite-based remote sensing analysis, only a handful of governments had the capability to deploy satellites and reliably process satellite imagery, and its use was largely limited to the military and intelligence communities. In the late 1950s, the US and Europe established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the (predecessors to) the European Space Agency (ESA) so as to support a civilian space program as well as space and aeronautics research. Even then, however, data access was unwieldy and often costly. For example, even if a researcher had identified the data they wanted to work with, they would have to go through the time-intensive steps of downloading the data on a computer with sufficient memory and performing a series of pre-processing steps (e.g. orthorectification and atmospheric corrections), all before they began to assess their main questions of interest. 

**Enter Google Earth Engine (GEE).** As part of Google's quest to make the world's information universally accessible and useful, Google Earth Engine emerged in 2010 to aid in organizing and simplifying geospatial data in a way that supports an end-to-end solution for analysis. This is a valuable tool simplifies many of the historical problems that Remote Sensing researchers have struggled with. It has collected petabytes of imagery from both public and private sources, including the most-used Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel data. Additionally, GEE allows users to process the data and conduct sophisticated analysis on their data of choice within Google's Cloud environment (for example even allowing advanced Machine Learning using TensorFlow Processing Units). They also geo-rectify the image and provide pre-built algorithms that facilitate analysis. In case you need to build your own algorithms, Google Earth Engine has built functionality within JavaScript and Python, which in turn extends the opportunities for processing data and displaying results. The user can even import their own data and work with it within GEE. Finally, the user owns the analysis and algorithms written within GEE, providing fair and open use.   

As researchers intending to use Remote Sensing, learning Google Earth Engine will provide an invaluable toolset throughout your career.
