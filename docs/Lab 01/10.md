# Remote Sensing Background

## Overview

The purpose of this lab is to introduce digital images, datum, and projections, as well as demonstrate concepts of spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolution. You will be introduced to image data from several sensors aboard various platforms. At the completion of the lab, you will be able to understand the difference between remotely sensed datasets based on sensor characteristics and how to choose an appropriate dataset based on these concepts.
